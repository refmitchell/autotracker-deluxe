      <p>
        This tool can be launched from <a href="usage.html">Tool
        panel</a>.  Select option 5, and click Run. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This tool will:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Calibrate the tracks (correct lens distortion, transform
            perspective, and scale to mm)
          </li>
          <li>Smooth the tracks using a basic univariate spline</li>
          <li>Produce and display (and save) a plot showing the smoothed tracks</li>
          <li>Compute some basic summary statistics for your tracks</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Optionally, all of your tracks can also be "zeroed" (translated so they begin at (0,0)). 
      </p>

      <p>
        Each intermediate stage produces a CSV file with the results, these are:
        <ol>
          <li>calibrated_tracks.csv</li>
          <li>smoothed_tracks.csv</li>
          <li>zeroed_tracks.csv (if enabled)</li>          
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        The software will also show a plot and a copy is stored in
        your project directory (by default this is called
        "processed_tracks.pdf"). This plot is here so you can visually
        inspect what the autotracker has done and see if there are any
        obvious problems before you work on the data.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
        This is not intended to be a publication-quality plot as I
        assume you'll have your own elements you want to emphasise!
        You can configure the software to output an eps or svg file
        (see below) which can be imported in Inkscape or Adobe
        Illustrator so you can use the plot as a basis for your own
        nicer plots.
      </div>

      <p>
        Basic summary statistics (length, displacement, straightness,
        time to exit, and speed) are computed for each track. These
        are displayed in the terminal but also saved in the project
        directory in "summary_statistics.csv". The mean and standard
        deviation over all tracks are also included in the final row. 
      </p>

      <h2>Available options</h2>
      <h4>Plot filename</h4>
      <p>
        Track processing will automatically produce a plot which is saved to a
        file in the project directory. You can specify the name of that file
        here.
      </p>
      <h4>Plot file format</h4>
      <p>
        Different file formats offer different advantages. Here you
        can choose from pdf, eps, svg, or png (at 400dpi).
      </p>

      <h4>Plot grid</h4>
      <p>
        When enabled, this option will include a grid on your plot
        which makes it easier to read off the x and y axes at
        different positions. This can be disabled if you just want the
        tracks.
      </p>

      <h4>Include legend</h4>
      <p>
        When enabled, this option will include a legend which tells
        you which colour is assigned to which track index.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        Matplotlib will cycle through ten unique colours before it starts to repeat. 
        If you have more than ten tracks for a given beetle then this means that some tracks
        will be plotted in the same colour.
      </div>

<h4>All tracks start at origin ("zero tracks")</h4>
      <p>
        This option will shift all tracks so that they start at
        (0,0). This can be useful if you want to quickly look at how
        the tracks are distributed but removes some information
        (e.g. placement variability with respect to the true arena
        centre).
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        You shouldn't use this option unless you know all of your
        tracks start at the arena centre and end at the arena's edge.
      </div>

      <h4> Smoothing spline degree</h4>
      <p>
        The calibrated tracks are smoothed using a
        <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline.html">
          UnivariateSpline
        </a>
        from scipy. Changing this parameter allows you to change the
        degree (<em>k</em>) of the smoothing function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practically this can affect how "smooth" your tracks appear
        but the main way to adjust that is to use the smoothing scale
        factor (see next entry).
      </p>

      <h4>Smoothing scale factor</h4>
      <p>
        When smoothing, there is a parameter <code>s</code> which
        controls the trade-off between the smoothness and accuracy of
        the output track
        (go <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/interpolate/smoothing_splines.html">
          here for more information
        </a>).
      </p>
      <p>
      This parameter is largely found by trial and error and
      "good" values depend on the statistics of the track. The software
      assumes all points in the track should get equal weight in the
      smoothing process (all points are equally meaningful), so we
      guess that
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          s = scale * (m * std)
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        where <code>scale</code> is a scaling factor, <code>m</code> is the length of the
        track and <code>std</code> is the standard deviation of the data (<code>s</code> is
        computed separately for x and y coordinates).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can change <code>scale</code> to be between 0 and 1; it's up to you to choose
        a value which makes sense.
      </p>


      <div class="note">
        <p>
          <b>This parameter is very sensitive!</b>

        </div>
        <hr>
        <p>
          Setting <code>scale == 0.3</code>

        <div align="center">

      </div>
      
      <div class="note">
        <b>
          If you apply too much smoothing, it will distort the
          start-points of your tracks.
        </b>
        <p>
          In the images above, you should be able to see that the
          starts of the tracks have been shifted by the smoothing
          process such that they no longer start at the origin. This
          is because smoothing is applied after the tracks are shifted
          to start at the origin.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Flip plot X/Y axis</h4>
      <p>
        When you plot your data, the tracks may appear different to the
        path you watched the beetle take. The path shape will be correct
        but it might be mirrored in one or both axes. There are two
        reasons this happens:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          OpenCV and Matplotlib use different coordinate systems so
          this guarantees that the data will be flipped in the x and y
          axis. (This is why these boxes are enabled by default.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Calibration can introduce an additional flip in one or both
          axes if the orientation of the chessboard in the video does
          not match the orientation of the chessboard generated
          internally*. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You should enable/disable these as you see fit. They won't
        change the statistics computed on the data, just the
        visualisation.
      </p>

      <p>
        *Why not just invert the chessboard? Because it makes no
        difference and it's easier to re-plot the data than regenerate
        the calibration.
