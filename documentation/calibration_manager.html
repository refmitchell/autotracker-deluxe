      The calibration manager allows you to generate a calibration
      file from your calibration video, import a calibration file from
      a separate project, or visually inspect the results of your
      calibration on a candidate image.

    <h4>Generate new calibration</h4>
    <p>
      This option will allow you to generate a calibration file from
      your calibration video using the Autocalibration tool.
    </p>
    <div align="center">

    </div>
    <p>
      This tool will open your calibration video, select N random
      frames in which chessboards can be found, then store the images
      and the detected chessboard corners (in
      project_directory/calibration_cache).
    </p>

    <p>
      You need to provide:

      <ol>
        <li>The number of frames you wish to use</li>
        <li>Some information describing the calibration</li>
        <li>A video frame where the chessboard is on the ground (for
          extrinsic calibration)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      The extrinsic claibration frame can be selected either from your
      calibration video (recommended) or from a file. To select a
      frame from your calibration video, use 'Select video frame',
      then use the trackbar to seek your frame in the video. Press 's'
      to save the frame; you should see the Extrinsic frame field
      update in the tool.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you've provided the necessary information, you can click
      'Generate!'. This will create a directory called
      calibration_cache in your project directory which will contain
      the calibration file (calibration.dt2c), all of the images used
      for calibration (intrinsic and extrinsic) and all of the
      detected chessboard corners in image coordinates.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>
        Generating a new calibration will overwrite any previous
        calibration for the current project. This includes the image
        cache.
      </em>
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <h4>My calibration keeps failing!</h4>
      <p>
        This process can fail for two reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The system couldn't find enough images with chessboards in
            order to compute lens distortion parameters.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this case it's likely that your chessboard is not
            configured correctly. Have a look at 'How to choose your
            dimensions' <a href="calibration_board_configuration.html">here</a>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This failure can also occur if the chessboard is damaged
            and therefore harder to detect. Reducing the number of frames
            you're looking for might help but in this case you will
            probably end up causing the second error type.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The computed distortion correction actually ends up
            distorting your extrinsic image so badly that the
            chessboard can't be found.
          </p>

          <p>
            The autocalibration tool will first work out lens
            distortion (intrinsic calibration), then try to correct
            for this before working out the camera position
            transformation (extrinsic calibration). If the intrinsic
            calibration is bad, then this will distort your extrinsic
            image and make extrinsic calibration impossible.</p>
          <p>
            You can fix this by simply not correcting for lens
            distortion. To do this, go to the Options screen from the
            main window. Under Autocalibration, there are four 'Fix'
            options ('Fix [K1 | K2 | K3 | tangental]'). Make sure all
            of these boxes are checked then try to run the
            autocalibration again.
          </p>

          <div class="warning">
            You should always <em>try</em> to correct for lens distortion first (have
            at least 'Fix K1' unchecked). If this fails, you can probably get
            away with not correcting for lens distortion if you are not
            using a wide angle lens.
          </div>
          
          <p>
            This type of failure can occur if your chessboard is
            damaged (i.e. if the pattern is distorted).
          </p>

    </div>

    <h4>Import existing calibration</h4>
    <p>
      If you already have a calibration which is working well, you can
      import this.  This button will open a file dialog which will
      allow you to select the calibration file you want to import.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calibration files are stored in the project directory &rarr;
      calibration_cache &rarr; calibration.dt2c.  Find the calibration
      file you want and click 'Open' in the file dialog.
    </p>

    <h4>Check calibration</h4>
    <p>
      This option will allow you to visually inspect your calibration
      to determine how good it is. You can also define a perfect
      circle to overlap with your arena.  Instructions and textual
      output are shown in the terminal.

    <h2>Available options (Autocalibration tool)</h2>
    <h4>Show default metainformation text</h4>
    <p>
      By default, the metainformation box in the autocalibration tool
      displays some instructive text. This can be annoying to delete
      once you know what to do, so uncheck this if you want the text box
      to appear blank.
    </p>
   
    <h4>Distortion coefficient settings</h4>
    <p>
      The remaining settings relate to the camera model used during
      calibration. You should not need to modify these but it may be
      necessary if the autocalibration tool is failing (see note above).
    </p>

    <h5>Fix K1</h5>
    <p>Fixes radial distortion parameter <em>k1</em> to a constant value.</p>

    <h5>Fix K2</h5>
    <p>Fixes radial distortion parameter <em>k2</em> to a constant value.</p>

    <h5>Fix K3</h5>
    <p>Fixes radial distortion parameter <em>k3</em> to a constant value.</p>

    <h5>Fix tangential</h5>
    <p>
      Autocalibration will assume zero tangential distortion. (If this
      is not true then set this camera aside for electrophysiology
      experiments.)
    </p>
    
    <div class="note">
      <h4>Why are most of these "fixed" by default?</h4>
      <p>
        In this context, "fixing" means that these parameters are set
        to a constant value and not used by the calibration system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default camera model assumes more variability than there
        should actually be for the cameras we use. Including all of
        the parameters in calibration tends to cause more harm than
        good. (The system tries to account for distortion which isn't
        actually there and ends up causing distortion.)
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, only <em>k1</em> is included in camera
        calibration. If you fix all four parameters then the camera
        model will assume that no lens distortion is added to your
        images.  This likely isn't true but it can be necessary if
        your calibration board is damaged, making it impossible to
        accurately compute lens distortion.
