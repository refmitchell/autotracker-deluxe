      This tool can be launched from <a href="usage.html">Tool
      panel</a>.  Select option 1, and click Run. This will open a
      small video selector window.
    </p>
    <div align="center">

    </div>
    <p>
      Clicking 'Select' will open a file dialog asking you what video file
      you want to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complete path to the video files is stored, so if the file 
      location is not going to change, you can simply reference the files 
      elsewhere on your hard drive. However, if the file location may 
      change or you are working off of an external hard drive, 
      you may want to make local copies. To do this, check the 
      'Copy video files locally?' option. This will make copies of the 
      videos in the project directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have selected your video files and determined whether you
      wish to make local copies, click 'Confirm'. Clicking 'Cancel' will 
      discard all changes.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
      <h4>Copying video files locally</h4>
      If you copied the files locally then the video filepaths stored by 
      the software will point to the local copies. Thus, if you run the 
      video selection tool again, the entries should show the local copy 
      path rather than the one you originally selected.
      <p></p>
      If you later update the video files for a given project and attempt 
      to copy them locally, this will overwrite the video files in the
      project directory. The software will ask for confirmation before 
      video files are deleted.
    </div>

    <h2>Available options</h2>
    <h4>Default video directory</h4>
    <p>
      This option specifies where the video selector will look for
      videos when you open the file dialog. The default option is "."
      which is shorthand for "the current working directory".
    </p>
    <p>
      You should change this to wherever you keep your videos.
