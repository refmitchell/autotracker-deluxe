        <h2>DungTrack 2 documentation</h2>
        <p>
            DungTrack 2 provides autotracking and basic track analysis for dung beetle orientation experiments.
            This software is designed for <em>arena-based</em> experiments. 
            It will work for other types of experiment but the feature set, user interface, and available analysis
            are designed for arena-based experiments.

            This documentation is written in basic HTML so that

            <ol>
                <li>Instructions can be divided into different linked pages.</li>
                <li>Everyone using the software will have access to software which can render the documentation (a web browser).</li>
                <li>Updating the source is relatively straightfoward (as easy as Markdown).</li>
            </ol>

            It's not pretty but it's functional.
