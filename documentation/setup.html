      <h2>Opening a terminal in the correct place</h2>
        If you already know how to use the terminal, switch into the autotracker-deluxe
        directory and jump to "Installing dependencies" below.
        <h3>MacOS</h3>
        Open Finder and navigate to the folder you downloaded from github. Hold
        control and click on the folder, then select 'Services' &rarr; 'New Terminal 
        at Folder'. A terminal window should open.
    
        <h3>Linux (Ubuntu)</h3>
        Open your file explorer, find the folder you downloaded, right click and
        select 'Open in Terminal'. This may be distribution dependent.

        <h2 id="sec:dependencies">Installing dependencies</h2>
        <p>
          The dependencies can be installed using
          a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">bash</a>
          script. Make sure the terminal is open in the autotracker
          directory, then run:
        </p>

        <code class="term">$ ./SETUP</code>

        <p>
            This script will:
            <ol>
                <li>Check for Python 3 and Pip 3 installations</li>
                <li>
                    Create a virtual environment (a sandbox in which you can install the dependencies without
                    affecting other software which is installed)
                </li>
                <li>Install the dependencies within this virtual environment</li>
                <li>Create a launcher for the tracking software</li>
            </ol>

            If you open the SETUP file in a text editor you can see what this 
            script does.
        </p>

        <div class="note">
            <h4>Note for Linux users</h4>
            If working with linux then you need to make sure python3-venv and python3-tk
            are installed. On Ubuntu you can achieve this by running:

            <p><code>$ sudo apt install python3-venv python3-tk</code></p>
        </div>        
        <p></p>
        <div class="note">
            <h4>Setup and launcher scripts</h4>
            To ease usage, python, pip, and virtual environment management are
            wrapped within bash scripts. If you don't want to run these scripts,
            then you can install the dependencies as normal using:
            <p><code class="term">$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
            and you can run the software with:
            <p><code class="term">$ python3 main.py</code></p>

            <em>
                If you're trying to use the setup script and it doesn't work
                then please <a href="https://github.com/refmitchell/autotracker-deluxe/issues/new/choose">post an issue</a>!
